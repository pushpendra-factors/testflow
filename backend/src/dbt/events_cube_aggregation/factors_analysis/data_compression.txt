Analysis of data compression for last 30 days -----
Steps of analysis of compression -----
- Fetch the raw records.
- Fetch the number of records present for website_aggregation.
- Finding the high cardinal columns for few projects.
- Remove Group by to check the aggregations count.

Accounts under consideration ----
    Heavy page views - 
    Razorpay, chargebee

    Moderate page views - 
    spotdraft - 12384898978000004, locad - 2251799835000003

    lower page views - 
    ourly, tradelanes

399, 2251799835000003, 2251799843000004, 12384898978000004 are having lesser compression ratio with all fields included.

Taking 12384898978000004, 399 for consideration.

Finding the high cardinal columns.
12384898978000004 -- landing_page_url - 408, initial_referrer_url - 340, city - 1732
399 - landing_page_url - 3827, initial_referrer_url - 6837, city - 10752




Next analysis if required -
lets analyse the queries compression on session and page view.
