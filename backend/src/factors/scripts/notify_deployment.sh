# Script to notify of the changes that are going to release.
#
# How it works:
#     1. Pull all the latest tags for the given IMAGE_NAME from Goggle container repository.
#     2. Get the latest tag for the image. Breaks it and extracts commit_id from it.
#     3. Use git log to get the all the commits since commit id used in latest tag.
#     4. Use slack App webhook to post a message from curl to a particular channel.
# 
# CHANNEL_TOKEN for the app is available at https://api.slack.com/apps/A018CF323HS/incoming-webhooks?
#     To enable post to a new channel use 'Add New Webhook to Workspace' on above link.
#     CHANNEL_TOKEN has to be set in ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc or passed explicitly to the 'make' command.
# 
# Sample Makefile target to set IMAGE_NAME and call this script before deployment:
#     export CHANNEL_TOKEN
#     pack-dashboard-caching: export IMAGE_NAME=dashboard-caching-job
#     pack-dashboard-caching: notify-deployment
#         docker build -t us.gcr.io/factors-$(ENV)/dashboard-caching-job:$(TAG) -f Dockerfile.dashboard_caching_job .
#
#     notify-deployment:
#         $(GOPATH)/src/factors/scripts/notify_deployment.sh
